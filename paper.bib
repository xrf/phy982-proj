  abstract =     {Resonances are important features of open quantum
                  systems. We study, in particular, unbound and loosely bound
                  nuclear systems. We model 5He and 6He in a few-body picture,
                  consisting of an alpha-particle core with one and two
                  valence neutrons respectively. Basis-expansion theory is
                  briefly explained and then used to expand the nuclear system
                  in the harmonic oscillator and momentum bases. We extend the
                  momentum basis into the complex plane, obtaining solutions
                  that form a Berggren basis. With the complex-momentum method
                  we are able to reproduce experimentally observed resonances
                  in 5He. The 5He Berggren basis solutions are used as a
                  single-particle basis to create many-body states in which we
                  expand the 6He system. For the two-body interaction between
                  the neutrons, we use two different phenomenological models:
                  a Gaussian and a Surface Delta Interaction (SDI). The
                  strength of each interaction is fitted to reproduce the 6He
                  ground state energy. With the Gaussian interaction we do not
                  obtain the 6He resonance, whereas with the SDI we do. The
                  relevant parts of the second quantization formalism is
                  summarized, and we briefly discuss a possible
                  implementation.},
